# MagicMirror
MM Tool

1. The config.js file can also be known as the main file as it is where all of the modules come together and are placed on their sections of the mirror display itself.

2. MMM-GoogleSheets is connected via web browser and as the name suggests, a google sheet and automatically updates when the google sheet is changed

3. MMM-GoogleDocs-Notes is connected via web browser and as it suggests, a google doc where you can display graphs and bar charts; perhaps the most flexible module on the mirror

4. MMM-ImagesPhotos displays the custom verdigris raspberryPi logo on the bottom left hand side of the screen and if you like can even seg through photos if more are desired

5. The clock is a basic default module and is very easy to change its time based on your location within its javascript

6. The currentweather module is another default module and you make it work by selecting an API key and location from https://openweathermap.org/

7. MMM-AirQuality is a simple air quality display for your area using a link from https://aqicn.org/city/

8. These are the only files that are going to need reconfiguring if you want to change anything, contact me for access to the google sheets and docs for when you would want to mess around with editing those or connecting them to Verdigris API
